# Neural Network optimizer implementation
From scratch implementation of Neural Network optimization on multi-class classification problem. The Neural Network consists of only one hidden layer for simplicity.

### Data 
For testing purposes, Swiss roll dataset is used. 

### Implementation
The implementation includes function for:
- feed-forward and backpropagation pass, 
- softmax and softplus, 
- loss, 
- initialization of parameters and 
- plotting. 


The optimization is done implementing steepest descent algoritm, with optional Armijo rule for selecting step size.
